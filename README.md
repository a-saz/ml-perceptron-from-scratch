# Neural Lab
This is a repo for my small projects associated with neural networks / data modeling.
Generally each will be implemented in a single Jupyter file.

## List
1. MLP network from scratch using only numpy, trained on the MNIST dataset.
2. LSTM network with a full implementation, borrowing some math and functionality from PyTorch.
