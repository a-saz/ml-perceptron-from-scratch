# ml-perceptron-from-scratch
Implementation of a simple multi-layer-perceptron neural network for the handwritten digit image recognition (MNIST dataset) from scratch using only numpy.

This .ipynb assumes the data is accessible as it is in the Kaggle workspace - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer.
To run it on your local instance of jupyter notebooks, adjust the path to the appropriate .csv data files.
